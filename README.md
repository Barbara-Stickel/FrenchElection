## FrenchElection

People say the media has a huge role in shaping the public opinion. But it is not always clear how it really affects the public opinion. For instance, we are not sure if the number of articles influence the public opinion. Therefore, in out project we wanted to ask the following questions:

<ol>
    <li>What does the media coverarge look like for each candidate?</li>
    <li>How does the public opinion change based on twitter tweets? Is there a correlation with the media coverage?</li>
    <li>What can we learn each candidate from their speech?</li>
    <li>Is there a difference between the public opinion about the party and the candidate?</li>
</ol>

To address those questions, we did different analysis about the number of article published by the media about the different candidates, the tweets and a sentimental analysis on the speech of the candidates.
